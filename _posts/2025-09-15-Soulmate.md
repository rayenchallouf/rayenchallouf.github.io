**Soulmate** is an **easy** rated room on **HackTheBox**
Without further ado, let‚Äôs begin.

>[!danger] 
>Don‚Äôt forget to add soulmate.htb to your /etc/hosts.

# 1. Initial Reconnaissance and Scanning:
### Nmap Scan:
Use Nmap to scan the target's open ports, services, and versions:

```console
nmap -sV -A <Target_IP>

``` 
![nmap](../images/soulmate/nmap.png)
### Understanding the Results:
We found :

‚óè**Port 22** (SSH): Useful later for remote access.  
‚óè**Port 80** (HTTP): Likely indicates a website is running.   

# 2.Enumeration :

With **port 80 (HTTP)** open, it's time to explore the website for hidden vulnerabilities or clues. This includes both manual inspection and automated enumeration of directories.

### Looking for subdomain:

During enumeration, we identified a subdomain named ftp

![scanning](../images/soulmate/sousdomain.png)

Navigated to ftp.soulmate.htb

![FTP](../images/soulmate/the_website.png)

Looks like the system is affected by CVE-2025-31161.

‚óè**CVE-2025-31161** Immersive-Labs-Sec/CVE-2025-31161: Proof of Concept for CVE-2025-31161
: [link](https://github.com/Immersive-Labs-Sec/CVE-2025-31161)

```bash
python cve-2025-31161.py --target_host ftp.soulmate.htb --port 80 --target_user root --new_user akolix --password akolix
```
![enumeration](../images/soulmate/enumeration.png)

We were able to log in using the newly created user account.

Next, we moved to the Admin section to explore available options.

![after_login](../images/soulmate/after_login.png)

Let‚Äôs check out User Management.

![User_Management](../images/soulmate/user_manager.png)

Found a user called ben ‚Äî looks worth checking out.

![the_user_ben](../images/soulmate/the_user_ben.png)

Looks like ben can upload files ‚Äî interesting üòä

![has_upload](../images/soulmate/has_upload.png)

Let‚Äôs set a new password for ben and log in.

![use_this_password](../images/soulmate/use_this_password.png)

Let‚Äôs check out the webProd directory.

# 3. Gaining Access

### Uploading a Reverse Shell:

Let‚Äôs upload a file now.

![add-file](../images/soulmate/add-file.png)

Uploaded MonkeyPenstest‚Äôs reverse shell to establish a connection.

**Pentestmonkey‚Äôs PHP reverse shell**: [link](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) 

![upload_it](../images/soulmate/upload_it.png)

Configured a listener on port 1339 with Netcat to catch the reverse shell.

![lisent](../images/soulmate/lisent.png)

Let‚Äôs go to soulmate.htb/rev.php to check it out.

Bingo! We‚Äôre in.

![get_the_shell](../images/soulmate/get_the_shell.png)

Found start.escript in /usr/local/lib/erlang_login and i found creds!

![creds_ben](../images/soulmate/creds_ben.png)

Let‚Äôs connect as ben now.

![connect-to-ben](../images/soulmate/connect-to-ben.png)

# 4. Privilege Escalation

Let‚Äôs see which ports are open and what services are running ‚Äî check for any conflicts.
Looks like port 2222 is running Erlang SSH.
Looks like root ran a login script before.

![services](../images/soulmate/services.png)

Let‚Äôs connect as ssh-runner now.

![connect-to-ssh-runner](../images/soulmate/connect-to-ssh-runner.png)

Opened the help menu to see how to work with ssh-runner.

![help](../images/soulmate/help.png)

i ran os:cmd("id") as the ssh_runner user.

## Conclusion

The Soulmate machine provided a straightforward path for practicing both web enumeration and privilege escalation on a Linux system. By carefully exploring the exposed services and subdomains, we identified a vulnerable FTP web service and exploited CVE-2025-31161 to create a new user. This initial foothold allowed us to explore the web application further, identify users with higher privileges, and upload a reverse shell to gain system access.

Once inside, further enumeration revealed credentials and an Erlang SSH service running on a non-standard port (2222). Leveraging these, we were able to escalate privileges and gain access as a more powerful user.

This box highlights the importance of:

‚óè Comprehensive enumeration (ports, subdomains, users).

‚óè Understanding known vulnerabilities and using public exploits safely.

‚óè Leveraging weak configurations for privilege escalation.

In summary, Soulmate is an excellent exercise in combining web exploitation with post-exploitation enumeration, demonstrating the step-by-step process from initial access to root/user privilege escalation.
